# FunFacts UI Design: Material UI Grid

## Overview
The FunFacts frontend will use Angular Material's grid system to display fun facts in a responsive, visually appealing layout. Each column in the grid will be collapsible, allowing users to expand or collapse sections for a cleaner interface.

## Layout
- Use Angular Material's `<mat-grid-list>` for the grid structure.
- Each fun fact will be displayed in a `<mat-card>` inside a grid tile.
- Columns will be collapsible using `<mat-expansion-panel>` or a similar component.

## Example Structure
```html
<mat-grid-list cols="3" rowHeight="fit">
  <mat-grid-tile *ngFor="let factGroup of funFactGroups">
    <mat-expansion-panel>
      <mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <mat-panel-title>
          {{ factGroup.title }}
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <div *ngFor="let fact of factGroup.facts">
        <mat-card>{{ fact }}</mat-card>
      </div>
    </mat-expansion-panel>
  </mat-grid-tile>
</mat-grid-list>
```

## Features
- Responsive grid layout
- Collapsible columns for better organization
- Material Design look and feel
Expose an [open] input to toggle the content's expanded or collapsed state
Animate the expansion and collapsing
Support basic accessibility features, including motion reduction for sensitive users and appropriate ARIA roles for assistive technologies
If the content is collapsed, it should be removed from the DOM

## Notes
- Adjust `cols` for different screen sizes using Angular Material's breakpoints.
- Use services to fetch fun facts dynamically.
- Style with SCSS for custom theming.
